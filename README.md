# ML Task â€“ ACM Club

This repository contains a basic machine learning task created for ACM club members to explore and understand the core steps of building an ML model using Python.

## Repository Structure

- `Untitled.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with all the steps and code
- Covers:
  - Data loading and inspection
  - Handling missing values
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Hyperparameter tuning

## Objective

The goal of this task is to give you a hands-on introduction to the typical ML workflow:

1. Understand the dataset
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Train a simple ML model (e.g., Decision Tree or SVM)
4. Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics
5. Improve performance using hyperparameter tuning

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common ML libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

Note: This task is designed to run in a local notebook environment. No setup instructions are provided as this is a club-level educational task.

## Purpose

This task is not meant for deployment or production use. It serves purely as a learning exercise for those new to machine learning.
